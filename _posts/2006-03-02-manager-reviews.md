Even in companies that have 360 degrees review process, the upward review is only to help managers get better. Wouldn't it be cool if employees could view their potential manager's rating before joining a group? This would be especially helpful in companies where there is a lot of inter-company movement. So typically before joining a group, I would look up the rating of that manager and then decide whether I wanted to work there or not. It would also help new hires to decide which group to join and so forth. It would need to open where individuals can come in and enter their company name, dept name, manager name and provide rating based on some simple parameters.
