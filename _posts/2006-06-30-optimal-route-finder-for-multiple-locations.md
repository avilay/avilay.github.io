If I want to go to 5 different places in a day (when I was apartment hunting), I went to google maps and manually figured out what the best path would be and then printed out the maps for each path. There needs to be a mashup that will take as input 'n' destinations and will figure out the most optimal path and then present in a way that is easy to print.
