When I am reading a particular web page, I sometimes want to add my own notes to that website. But I am not organized enough to maintain my notes in some central location. Even google notebook does not help because it is just a collection of notes. I would ideally like to flip the page over, scribble my notes and go back to what I was doing. Then whenever I am on that website, I want to flip my web page back and see what I had scribbled the last time I was there. Ofcourse flipping webpages is still some ways off. I could use delicious notes to associate notes with a particular url. Then whenever I am on a particular website, my browser plugin would go to delcious and fetch whatever notes match that website/URL.
