Semantic markup for services can be somehow extended to a search engine for apps. All proprietary platforms have a directory of apps that users can search and download. If mobile apps were written in mobile friendly HTML and could be specially searchable using semantic markup then there would be a whole lot of choice of apps which are organically searcheable.
